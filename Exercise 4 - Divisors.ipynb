#Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

print("start program")

number = int(input("Enter a number:"))
a = []

for x in range(2, number-1):
    if number%x == 0:
        a.append(x)

print(a)
