    "#This exercise is Part 2 of 4 of the Tic Tac Toe exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 1, Part 3, and Part 4.\n",

    "#As you may have guessed, we are trying to build up to a full tic-tac-toe board. However, this is significantly more than half an hour of coding, so we’re doing it in pieces.\n",

    "#Your task this week: given a 3 by 3 list of lists that represents a Tic Tac Toe game board, tell me whether anyone has won, and tell me which player won, if any. A Tic Tac Toe win is 3 in a row - either in a row, a column, or a diagonal. Don’t worry about the case where TWO people have won - assume that in every board there will only be one winner.\n",
